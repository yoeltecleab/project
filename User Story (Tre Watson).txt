Scenario:  
Maria is a young professional who recently decided to adopt a healthier lifestyle. She first discovers a fitness and nutrition app through an Instagram ad and influencer recommendations. Intrigued, she checks out the app store page, reads reviews, and watches a few video demos before deciding to download the free trial.  


As Maria starts using the app, she logs her meals and tracks her water intake but finds the process tedious and time-consuming. She occasionally forgets to log her meals, which impacts her motivation. After a few weeks, she feels discouraged as her progress is slow, and the text-heavy reports don’t keep her engaged.  


However, Maria is notified about a new tracking feature that includes badges and progress rewards. She starts using the feature, and her motivation improves. She also joins the in-app community, where she shares her progress and learns from others. Over time, Maria becomes an active user who engages in wellness challenges and invites friends to join.
